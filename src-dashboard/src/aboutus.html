            <div class="section fade-in">
                <p class="description">AURA (Adaptive User Reflective Assistant) is an AI-powered application designed to enhance productivity, learning, and studying through an intuitive and adaptive user experience. We have curated an algorithm integrating cognitive psychology principles and artificial intelligence to enhance your learning or productivity through spaced repetition, and allows you to adapt to how you want to study in an effective way! </p>

            <h2>Why AURA?</h2>

            <div class="section fade-in">
                <p class="description">AURA is not just an application for you to use, or a replacement for normal learning. Whether you’re working, studying, or creating, AURA provides an environment that enhances focus and helps improve your productivity. Your workflow, illuminated. Your experience, personalized. </p>

            <div class="section fade-in">
                <p class="description">We’re a small team composed of students focused on making AURA personable and effective for everyone. We know how difficult it is as students to sometimes to be productive and learn in an efficient way, so we’ve created something that won’t replace your usual routines, but rather enhance and adapt to you!</p>
